# Task Summary

## What we're building

Describe your project here.

## Constraints / preferences

- **Language/stack:** Modern **TypeScript**, using **Deno** for tooling (typecheck, lint, fmt, test, bundling, tasks).
- **Shipping target:** Static deployment (e.g. **GitHub Pages**) where users can just visit a URL.
- **No backend initially:** The app should be fully playable client-side first.

## Testing expectations

- Write **Deno unit tests** and other headless validations so core logic can be verified without manual browser testing.
- Prefer a design that makes business logic testable without a DOM.

## Later ambitions

- Add additional features here as the project evolves.

## Out of scope (for the first phases)

- Define what's not being built yet.
